1. The general trend in the curve is toward more accuracy as the percentage used for training grows.
2. The bottom of the curve seems to have more noise because when the computer doesn't have as much training its identifications are more random.
3. Honestly I can't get a smooth curve no matter how many trials I use! After about 200 it stops making any difference.
4. The closer C is to 1, the closer the graph is to a straight line. At very low values of C (~10**-15) the upper right portion of the graph gets noisier as well.
